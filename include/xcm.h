 * @section introduction Introduction
 *
 * This is the API documentation for the Extensible Connection-oriented
 * Messaging (XCM) library.
 *
 * The XCM API consists of the following parts:
 * * Core API: xcm.h.
 * * Address handling library: xcm_addr.h.
 * * Socket attribute APIs: xcm_attr.h and xcm_attr_map.h.
 * * API and implementation version information: xcm_version.h.
 * * Obsolete (but still available) APIs: xcm_compat.h.
 *
 * @author Mattias Rönnblom
 * @version 0.26 [API]
 * @version 1.11.1 [Implementation]
 *
 * The low API/ABI version number is a result of all XCM releases
 * being backward compatible, and thus left the major version at 0.
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 *
 * XCM is a shared library implementing an inter-process communication
 * service on Linux. It facilitates communication between processes on
 * the same system, as well as over a network.
 *
 * XCM internals are divided into the core library, and a number of
 * pluggable transports, handling the actual data delivery. In
 * combination with an URL-like addressing scheme, it allows
 * applications to be transport agnostic, and an IPC mechanism
 * suitable for one deployment can seamlessly be replaced with
 * another, in another deployment. The API semantics are the same,
 * regardless of underlying transport used.
 *
 * An XCM transport either provides a messaging or a byte stream type
 * service.
 *
 * XCM supports UNIX domain sockets for efficient local-only
 * communication, and TCP, TLS and SCTP for remote inter-process
 * communication. The service XCM provides is of the
 * connection-oriented, client-server type. It is not a message bus
 * and does not implement the publish-subscribe or broadcast patterns.
 *
 * This document primarily serves as an API specification, but also
 * also contains information specific to the implementation.
 *
 * XCM reuses much of the terminology of the BSD Sockets API. Compared
 * to the BSD Sockets API, XCM has more uniform semantics across
 * underlying transports.
 *
 * @section semantics Overall Semantics
 *
 * XCM implements a connection-oriented, client-server model. The
 * server process creates one or more server sockets (e.g, with
 * xcm_server()) bound to a specific address, after which clients may
 * successfully establish connections to the server. When a connection
 * is establishment, two connection sockets will be created; one on
 * the server side (e.g., returned from xcm_accept()), and one of the
 * client side (e.g., returned from xcm_connect()). Thus, a server
 * serving multiple clients will have multiple sockets; one server
 * socket and N connection sockets, one each for every client. A
 * client will typically have one connection socket for each server it
 * is connected to.
 *
 * User application data (messages or bytes, depending on service
 * type) are always sent and received on a particular connection
 * socket - never on a server socket.
 *
 * @subsection service_types Messaging and Byte Streams
 *
 * An XCM transport either provides a messaging or a byte stream service.
 *
 * Messaging transports preserve message boundaries across the
 * network. The buffer passed to xcm_send() constitutes one (and only
 * one) message. What's received on the other end, in exactly one
 * xcm_receive() call, is a buffer with the same length and contents.
 *
 * The @ref ux_transport, @ref tcp_transport, @ref tls_transport, @ref
 * utls_transport, and @ref sctp_transport all provide a messaging type
 * service.
 *
 * For byte streams, there's no such thing as message boundaries: the
 * data transported on the connection is just a sequence of bytes. The
 * fact that xcm_send() accepts an array of bytes of a particular
 * length, as opposed to individual bytes one-by-one, is a mere
 * performance optimization.
 *
 * For example, if two messages "abc" and "d" are passed to xcm_send()
 * on to a messaging transport, they will arrive as "abc" and "d" in
 * exactly two xcm_receive() call on the receiver. On a byte stream
 * transport however, all the data "abcd" may arrive in a single
 * xcm_receive(), or it may arrive in multiple calls, such as three
 * calls, each producing "ab", "c", and "d", respectively, or any
 * other combination.
 *
 * The @ref btls_transport and @ref btcp_transport transports provide
 * a byte stream service.
 *
 * Applications that allow the user to configure an arbitrary XCM
 * address, but are designed to handle only a certain service type,
 * may limit what type of sockets may be instantiated to be of only
 * the messaging service type, or only byte stream, by passing the
 * "xcm.service" attribute with the appropriate value (see @ref
 * xcm_attr for details) at the time of socket creation. Because of
 * XCM's history as a messaging-only framework, "xcm.service" defaults
 * to "messaging".
 *
 * Applications which are designed to handle both messaging and byte
 * stream transports may retrieve the value of "xcm.service" and use
 * it to differentiate the treatment where so is required (e.g., in
 * xcm_send() return code handling).
 *
 * Connections spawned off a server socket (e.g., with xcm_accept())
 * always have the same service type as their parent socket.
 *
 * @subsubsection max_msg_size Max Message Size
 *
 * The XCM API and the various messaging type transports are designed
 * for relatively small messages. For bulk data transfer, an
 * application needs either employ fragmentation and reassembly, or
 * use a byte stream transport.
 *
 * The @p xcm.max_msg_size socket attribute specifies the maximum
 * message size (see @ref xcm_attr).
 *
 * Current XCM transports do not negotiate the maximum message size,
 * so the @p xcm.max_msg_size limit denotes the @em local limit
 * only. The remote end will reject messages larger than @em its
 * limit, and may tear down the connection as a result. Application
 * protocol level signaling or lockstep upgrade may be required to
 * resolve such issues.
 *
 * Historically, all messaging type transports in XCM have used a
 * maximum message size of 65535 bytes. This limit was never exposed
 * in the API, so subsequent changes to message size limits did not
 * impact the API/ABI.
 *
 * As of XCM v1.11.1, the maximum message size varies across different
 * transports.
 *
 * Applications using stack-allocated message buffers may want to
 * impose their own upper limit (e.g., @p sizeof(msgbuf)) on top of
 * the @p xcm.max_msg_size, to avoid overrunning the stack if linked
 * to a newer, message size-wise more capable, XCM library version.
 *
 * @subsection ordering Ordering Guarantees
 *
 * In-order delivery - that data arrives at the recipient in the same
 * order it was sent by the sender - is guaranteed, but only for data
 * sent on the same connection.
 *
 * @subsection flow_control Flow Control
 *
 * XCM transports support flow control. Thus, if the sender message
 * rate or bandwidth is higher than the network or the receiver can
 * handle on a particular connection, xcm_send() in the sender process
 * will eventually block (or return an error EAGAIN, if in
 * non-blocking mode). Unless XCM is used for bulk data transfer (as
 * oppose to signaling traffic), xcm_send() blocking because of slow
 * network or a slow receiver should be rare in practice. TCP, TLS,
 * and UNIX domain socket transports all have large protocol windows
 * and/or socket buffers to allow a large amount of outstanding data.
 *
 * @section addressing Addressing and Transport Selection
 *
 * In XCM, the application is in control of which transport will be
 * used, using the address supplied to xcm_connect() and xcm_server()
 * including both the transport name and the transport address.
 *
 * However, there is nothing preventing an XCM transport to use a more
 * abstract addressing format, and internally include multiple
 * underlying IPC transport mechanism. This model is implemented by
 * the @ref utls_transport.
 *
 * @subsection address_syntax Address Syntax
 *
 * Addresses are represented as
 * strings with the following general syntax:
 * <tt><transport-name>:<transport-address></tt>
 *
 * For the UX UNIX Domain Socket transport, the addresses has this
 * more specific form: @n
 * @code ux:<UNIX domain socket name> @endcode
 *
 * The addresses of the UXF UNIX Domain Socket transport variant
 * have the following format: @n
 * @code uxf:<file system path> @endcode
 *
 * For the TCP, TLS, UTLS, SCTP, BTCP and BTLS transports the syntax is: @n
 * @code
 * tcp:(<DNS domain name>|<IPv4 address>|[<IPv6 address>]|[*]|*):<port>
 * tls:(<DNS domain name>|<IPv4 address>|[<IPv6 address>]|[*]|*):<port>
 * utls:(<DNS domain name>|<IPv4 address>|[<IPv6 address>]|[*]|*):<port>
 * sctp:(<DNS domain name>|<IPv4 address>|[<IPv6 address>]|[*]|*):<port>
 * btcp:(<DNS domain name>|<IPv4 address>|[<IPv6 address>]|[*]|*):<port>
 * btls:(<DNS domain name>|<IPv4 address>|[<IPv6 address>]|[*]|*):<port>
 * @endcode
 *
 * '*' is a shorthand for '0.0.0.0' (i.e. bind to all IPv4
 * interfaces).  '[*]' is the IPv6 equivalent, creating a server
 * socket accepting connections on all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
 *
 * Some example addresses:
 * @code
 * tcp:*:4711
 * tls:192.168.1.42:4711
 * tcp:[::1]:99
 * tcp:[*]:4711
 * tls:service:4711
 * sctp:service.company.com:42
 * btls:*:42
 * @endcode
 *
 * For TCP, TLS, UTLS, SCTP, BTLS and BTCP server socket addresses,
 * the port can be set to 0, in which case XCM (or rather, the Linux
 * kernel) allocates a free TCP port from the local port range.
 *
 * @subsubsection dns DNS Resolution
 *
 * For transports allowing a DNS domain name as a part of the address,
 * the transport will attempt to resoĺv the name to an IP address. A
 * DNS domain name may resolv to zero or more IPv4 addresses and/or
 * zero or more IPv6 addresses. XCM relies on the operating system to
 * prioritize between IPv4 and IPv6.
 *
 * By default, XCM will only connect to the first (highest-priority)
 * IP address provided by DNS. This behavior can be changed for all
 * TCP-based transports using the "dns.algorithm" attribute. See
 * @ref dns_attr for more information.
 *
 * @subsubsection ip_addr_format IPv4 Address Format
 *
 * XCM accepts IPv4 addresses in the dotted-decimal format
 * @code
 * 130.236.254.2
 * @endcode
 *
 * XCM allows only complete addresses with three '.', and not the
 * archaic, classful, forms, where some bytes where left out, and thus
 * the address contained fewer separators.
 *
 * @subsubsection scope IPv6 Link Local Addresses
 *
 * IPv6 link local addresses (i.e., fe80::/10) are not guaranteed to
 * be unique outside a particular broadcast domain. To create such a
 * socket an application must, besides the link local address to use,
 * also supply a scope identifier, to allow the kernel to select which
 * network interface to use.
 *
 * The IPv6 scope id is not a part of an XCM address, but instead
 * provided by the application as a socket attribute "ipv6.scope".
 * See @ref tcp_attr for details.
 *
 * The rationale for this URI-style design choice, compared to the
 * also-common practice to include a network interface name in the
 * address ("<IPv6 address>%<if-name>"), is that the IPv6 scope
 * identifiers are strictly local to the node and thus conceptually
 * not a part of the address. One host may use a particular scope id
 * to refer to a particular network, and another host on the same
 * network may use a different.
 *
 * @section dpd Dead Peer Detection
 *
 * XCM transports attempt to detect a number of conditions which can
 * lead to lost connectivity, and does so even on idle connections.
 *
 * If the remote end closes the connection, the local xcm_receive()
 * will return 0. If the process on the remote end crashed,
 * xcm_receive() will return -1 and set errno ECONNRESET. If network
 * connectivity to the remote end is lost, xcm_receive() will return
 * -1 and errno will be set to ETIMEDOUT.
 *
 * @section error_handling Error Handling
 *
 * In general, XCM follows the UNIX system API tradition when it comes
 * to error handling. Where possible, errors are signaled to the
 * application by using unused parts of the value range of the
 * function return type. For functions returning signed integer types,
 * this means the value of -1 (in case -1 is not a valid return
 * value). For functions returning pointers, NULL is used to signal
 * that an error has occurred. For functions where neither -1 or NULL
 * can be used, or where the function does not return anything
 * (side-effect only functions), an 'int' is used as the return type,
 * and is used purely for the purpose to signal success (value 0), or
 * an error (-1) to the application.
 *
 * The actual error code is stored in the thread-local errno
 * variable. The error codes are those from the fixed set of errno
 * values defined by POSIX, found in errno.h. Standard functions such
 * as perror() and strerror() may be used to turn the code into a
 * human-readable string.
 *
 * In non-blocking operation, given the fact the actual transmission
 * might be defered (and the message buffered in the XCM layer), and
 * that message receive processing might happen before the application
 * has called receive, the error being signaled at the point of a
 * certain XCM call might not be a direct result of the requested
 * operation, but rather an error discovered previously.
 *
 * The documentation for xcm_finish() includes a list of generic error
 * codes, applicable xcm_connect(), xcm_accept(), xcm_send() and
 * xcm_receive().
 *
 * Also, for errors resulting in an unusable connection, repeated
 * calls will produce the same errno.
 *
 * @section select Event-driven Programming Support
 *
 * In UNIX-style event-driven programming, a single application thread
 * handles multiple clients (and thus multiple XCM connection sockets)
 * and the task of accepting new clients on the XCM server socket
 * concurrently (although not in parallel). To wait for events from
 * multiple sources, an I/O multiplexing facility such as select(2),
 * poll(2) or epoll(2) is used.
 *
 * Each XCM socket is represented by a single fd, retrieved with
 * xcm_fd(). The fd number and underlying file object remains the same
 * across the life-time of the socket.
 *
 * In the BSD Sockets API, the socket fd being readable means it's
 * likely, but not guaranteed, that the application can successfully
 * read data from the socket. Similarly, a fd marked writable by for
 * example poll() signifies that the application is likely to be able
 * to write data to the socket.
 *
 * An application using non-blocking XCM sockets must @a always wait
 * for the XCM socket fd to become @a readable (e.g., the XCM socket
 * fd should always be in the @p readfds in the select() call),
 * <em>regardless of the target condition</em>. Thus, even if the
 * application is waiting for an opportunity to send a message on a
 * XCM socket, or is not interested in performing any type of
 * operation on the socket, it must wait for the XCM socket fd to
 * become readable. Not being interested in performing any operation
 * here means that the application has the xcm_await() condition set
 * to 0, and is neither interested in waiting to call xcm_send(),
 * xcm_receive(), nor xcm_accept() on the socket.
 *
 * An application must always include @a all of its XCM socket fds
 * into @p readfds in the select() call. An application must not leave
 * an XCM socket unattended in the sense its fd is not in the set of
 * fds passed to select() and/or neither of xcm_send(), xcm_receive(),
 * xcm_accept() or xcm_finish() are called when its fd is marked
 * readable by select().
 *
 * @subsection select_variants Supported I/O Multiplexing Facilities
 *
 * XCM is oblivious to what I/O multiplexing mechanism employed by the
 * application. It may call select(), poll() or epoll_wait() directly,
 * or make use of any of the many available event loop libraries (such
 * as libevent). For simplicity, select() is used in this
 * documentation to denote the whole family of Linux I/O multiplexing
 * facilities.
 *
 * @subsection non_blocking_ops Non-blocking Operation
 *
 * An event-driven application needs to set the XCM sockets it handles
 * into non-blocking mode, by calling xcm_set_blocking(), setting the
 * "xcm.blocking" socket attribute, or using the XCM_NONBLOCK flag in
 * xcm_connect().
 *
 * For XCM sockets in non-blocking mode, all potentially blocking API
 * calls related to XCM connections - xcm_connect(), xcm_accept(),
 * xcm_send(), and xcm_receive() - finish immediately.
 *
 * The inability to finish the requested operation without blocking
 * the thread (i.e., putting the thread to sleep) is signaled in the
 * typical UNIX manner, by returning an NULL or -1, (depending on the
 * return type) and setting errno to EAGAIN. Unlike most other errno
 * values, EAGAIN is a temporary condition, and not a fatal error.
 *
 * For xcm_send(), xcm_connect() and xcm_accept(), XCM signaling
 * success means that the XCM layer has accepted the request. It may
 * or may not have completed the operation.
 *
 * @subsubsection non_blocking_connect Non-blocking Connection Establishment
 *
 * In case the @ref XCM_NONBLOCK flag is set in the xcm_connect()
 * call, or in case the an XCM server socket is in non-blocking mode
 * at the time of an xcm_accept() call, the newly created XCM
 * connection returned to the application may be in a semi-operational
 * state, with some internal processing and/or signaling with the
 * remote peer still required before actual message transmission and
 * reception may occur.
 *
 * The application may attempt to send or receive messages on such
 * semi-operational connections.
 *
 * There are ways for an application to determine when connection
 * establishment or the task of accepting a new client have
 * completed. See @ref outstanding_tasks for more information.
 *
 * @subsubsection non_blocking_send_receive Non-blocking Send and Receive
 *
 * To receive a message on an XCM connection socket in non-blocking
 * mode, the application may need to wait for the right conditions to
 * arise (i.e. a message being available). The application needs to
 * inform the socket that it wants to receive by calling xcm_await()
 * with the @p XCM_SO_RECEIVABLE bit in the @p condition bit mask set.
 * It will pass the fd it received from xcm_fd() into select(), asking
 * to get notified when the fd becomes readable. When select() marks
 * the socket fd as readable, the application should issue
 * xcm_receive() to attempt to retrieve a message.
 *
 * xcm_receive() may also called on speculation, prior to any select()
 * call, to poll the socket for incoming messages.
 *
 * An XCM connection socket may have a number of messages buffered,
 * and applications should generally, for optimal performance, repeat
 * xcm_receive() until it returns an error, and errno is set to
 * EAGAIN.
 *
 * Similarly to receiving a message, an application may set the @p
 * XCM_SO_SENDABLE bit in the @p condition bit mask, if it wants to
 * wait for a socket state where it's likely it can successfully send
 * a message. When select() marks the socket fd as @a readable, the
 * application should attempt to send a message.
 *
 * Just like with xcm_receive(), it may also choose to issue a
 * xcm_send() call on speculation (i.e. without going into select()),
 * which is often a good idea for performance reasons.
 *
 * For send operations on non-blocking connection sockets, XCM may
 * buffer whole or part of the message (or data, for byte stream
 * transports) before transmission to the lower layer. This may be due
 * to socket output buffer underrun, or the need for some in-band
 * signaling, like cryptographic key exchange, to happen before the
 * transmission of the complete message may finish. The XCM layer will
 * (re-)attempt to hand the message over to the lower layer at a
 * future call to xcm_finish(), xcm_send(), or xcm_receive().
 *
 * For applications wishing to determine when all buffered data have
 * successfully been deliver to the lower layer, may use xcm_finish()
 * to do so. Normally, applications aren't expected to require this
 * kind of control. Please also note that the fact a message has left
 * the XCM layer doesn't necessarily mean it has successfully been
 * delivered to the recipient. In particular, if for some reason the
 * data can be dispatched immediately, it may be lingering in kernel
 * buffers. Such buffers may be discarded in case the application
 * close the connection.
 *
 * @subsubsection outstanding_tasks Finishing Outstanding Tasks
 *
 * xcm_connect(), xcm_accept(), xcm_send() may all leave the socket in
 * a state where work is initiated, but not completed. In addition,
 * the socket may have pending internal tasks, such flushing the
 * output buffer into the TCP/IP stack, processing XCM control
 * interface messages, or finishing the TLS hand shake procedure.
 *
 * After waking up from a select() call, where a particular XCM
 * non-blocking socket's fd is marked readable, the application must,
 * if no xcm_send(), xcm_receive() or xcm_accept() calls are to be
 * made, call xcm_finish(). This is to allow the socket to finish any
 * outstanding tasks, even in the case the application has no
 * immediate plans for the socket.
 *
 * Prior to changing a socket from non-blocking to blocking mode, any
 * outstanding tasks should be finished, or otherwise the switch might
 * cause xcm_set_blocking() to return -1 and set errno to EAGAIN.
 *
 * @subsection might_block Ready Status Semantics
 *
 * For example, if a server socket's desired condition has been set
 * (with xcm_await()) to @p XCM_SO_ACCEPTABLE, and the application
 * wakes up from select() with the socket's fd marked readable, a call
 * to xcm_accept() may still not produce a new connection socket.
 *
 * The same holds true when reaching @p XCM_SO_RECEIVABLE and a
 * xcm_receive() call is made, and @p XCM_SO_SENDABLE and calls to
 * xcm_send().
 *
 * @subsection nb_examples Non-blocking Example Sequences
 *
 * @subsubsection nb_connect_and_send Connect and Send Message
 *
 * In this example, the application connects and tries to send a
 * message, before knowing if the connection is actually
 * established. This may fail (for example, in case TCP and/or
 * TLS-level connection establishment has not yet been completed), in
 * which case the application will fall back and wait with the use of
 * xcm_await(), xcm_fd() and select().

 * @enduml
 *
 * @subsubsection nb_delayed_connection_refused Delayed Connection Refused
 *
 * In many cases, the application is handed a connection socket before
 * the connection establishment is completed. Any errors occuring
 * during this process is handed over to the application at a future
 * call to xcm_finish(), xcm_send() or xcm_receive().

 *
 * In this sequence, a server accepts a new connection, and continues

 * @section attributes Socket Attributes
 *
 * Associated to a XCM server or connection socket is a set of XCM
 * socket attributes.
 *
 * Socket attributes represent both read-only state (e.g., TCP
 * round-trip time), and read-write run-time configuration (e.g., TCP
 * keepalive configuration).
 *
 * Which attributes are present varies across different transports,
 * socket types (i.e., server or connection) and socket states (i.e.,
 * fully established or not).
 *
 * The socket attribute API <xcm_attr.h> provides access to
 * transport-specific parameters, without the need to extend the API
 * with transport-specific function calls.
 *
 * Socket attributes are organized as a tree. An attribute's name is a
 * string which describes a path to a node in the tree. The leaf nodes
 * are one of a number of primitive types, such as integers and
 * strings (see <xcm_attr_types.h> for the full list). Composite
 * (interior) nodes are either dictionaries or lists.
 *
 * An attribute may be read-only, write-only or available both for
 * reading and writing. This is referred to as the attribute's mode.
 * The mode may vary across the lifetime of the socket. For example,
 * an attribute may be writable at the time of the xcm_connect_a()
 * call, and read-only thereafter.
 *
 * @subsection attribute_names Attribute Names
 *
 * An attribute name (or, path name) is a string consisting of a
 * sequence of dictionary keys and list indices. Keys are separated by
 * a colon ".", and indices are enclosed in square brackes
 * "[<index>]".
 *
 * Read from the left, each segment in the path moves one level away
 * from the root.
 *
 * Here are some examples of attribute path names:
 * @code
 * xcm.blocking
 * tls.peer.cert.san.emails[2]
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection attribute_values Attribute Values
 *
 * The attribute's value is coded in the native C data type and native
 * CPU byte order. Strings are NUL-terminated, and the NUL character
 * is included in the length of the attribute. There are four value
 * types; a boolean type, a 64-bit signed integer type, a string type,
 * a type for arbitrary binary data, and a double-precision floating
 * point type. See xcm_attr_types.h for details.
 *
 * In the current API, only leaf nodes can be accessed (e.g., it's not
 * possible to retrieve a list or a dictionary as a single call).
 *
 * The attribute access API is in xcm_attr.h.
 *
 * @subsection attribute_structure Basic Structure
 *
 * The socket attribute tree has an unnamed root. This root dictionary
 * has a number of keys.
 *
 * The generic XCM attributes, available in all transports, are
 * organized under the "xcm" key. Transport-specific attributes are
 * prefixed with the transport or protocol name (e.g. "tcp" for
 * TCP-specific attributes applicable to the TLS, BTLS, TCP, and BTCP
 * transports).
 *
 * @subsection attribute_access Attribute Access
 *
 * Retrieving the value of an attribute is done using xcm_attr_get(),
 * or any of its many type-specific convenience functions.
 *
 * Below is an example of reading an integer attribute value.
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * int64_t rtt;
 * xcm_attr_get_int(tcp_conn_socket, "tcp.rtt", &rtt);
 * printf("Current TCP round-trip time estimate is %ld us.", rtt);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Iterating over a list may look something like below.
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * int len = xcm_attr_get_list_len(tls_conn_socket, "tls.peer.cert.san.dns");
 *
 * for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
 *     char name[256];
 *     xcm_attr_getf_str(tls_conn_socket, name, sizeof(name),
 *                       "tls.peer.cert.san.dns[%d]", i);
 *     printf("DNS subject alternative name: %s\n", name);
 * }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Modyfing the value of an attribute is done using xcm_attr_set(), or
 * any of its many type-specific convenience functions.
 *
 * For example, setting the value of a boolean attribyte may be done
 * like below.
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * xcm_attr_set_bool(tcp_conn_socket, "tcp.keepalive", false);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Please note that all of these examples lack the error handling
 * required in a real application.
 *
 * @subsection attr_bulk Socket Instantiation Configuration
 *
 * An application may modify multiple attributes in one go, as a part
 * of socket creation, by populating an attribute map and passing it
 * to xcm_connect_a(), xcm_server_a(), or xcm_accept_a().
 *
 * Certain attributes' default values (e.g., attribute controlling
 * what TLS credentials are used) may only be modified in this manner.
 *
 * Each key-value pair in the attribute maps is used as an instruction
 * to set a node in the socket attribute tree to a particular
 * value. The node's path is the key's name, and new desired value of
 * the node is the key's value.
 *
 * The attribute sets are represented by the @c xcm_attr_map type in
 * xcm_attr_map.h.
 *
 * The caller retains the ownership of the attribute map passed to
 * xcm_connect_a(), xcm_server_a(), or xcm_accept_a(), and may destroy
 * it after the call has completed, or reuse it.
 *
 * A somewhat contrived example:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * struct xcm_attr_map *attrs = xcm_attr_map_create();
 * xcm_attr_map_add_bool(attrs, "xcm.blocking", false);
 * xcm_attr_map_add_str(attrs, "xcm.local_addr", "tls:192.168.1.42:0");
 * xcm_attr_map_add_bool(attrs, "tls.verify_peer_name", true);
 * xcm_attr_map_add_str(attrs, "tls.peer_names", "myservice");
 * xcm_attr_map_add_int64(attrs, "tcp.keepalive_interval", 10);
 *
 * struct xcm_socket *conn = xcm_connect_a("tls:192.168.1.99:4711", attrs);
 *
 * xcm_attr_map_destroy(attrs);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * @subsection xcm_attr_inheritance Attribute Inheritance
 *
 * Connection sockets spawned off a server sockets will inherit the
 * server socket's attributes that also applies to connection sockets.
 * An application may override such values by passing a different
 * values in the xcm_accept_a() call.
 *
 * @subsection xcm_attr Generic Attributes
 *
 * These attributes are expected to be found on XCM sockets regardless
 * of transport type.
 *
 * For TCP and BTCP transport-specific attributes, see @ref tcp_attr,
 * and for TLS and BTLS, see @ref tls_attr. For DNS-related attributes
 * (shared among all TCP-based transports) see @ref dns_attr.
 *
 * Attribute Name | Socket Type | Value Type | Mode | Description
 * ---------------|-------------|------------|------|------------
 * xcm.type       | All         | String     | R    | The socket type: "server" or "connection".
 * xcm.transport  | All         | String     | R    | The transport type.
 * xcm.service    | All         | String     | RW   | The service type: "messaging" or "bytestream". Writable only at the time of socket creation. If specified, it may be used by an application to limit the type of transports being used. The string "any" may be used to signify that any type of service is accepted. The default value is "messaging".
 * xcm.local_addr | All         | String     | RW   | The local address of a socket. Writable only if supplied to xcm_connect_a() together with a TLS, UTLS or TCP type address. Usually only needs to be written on multihomed hosts, in cases where the application needs to specify the source IP address to be used. Also see xcm_local_addr().
 * xcm.blocking   | All         | Boolean    | RW    | See xcm_set_blocking() and xcm_is_blocking(). The default value is true.
 * xcm.remote_addr | Connection | String     | R    | See xcm_remote_addr().
 * xcm.max_msg_size | Connection | Integer   | R    | The local maximum size of any message transported by this connection. The remote end may have a different opinion on what is the upper limit.
 *
 * @subsubsection cnt_attr Generic Counter Attributes
 *
 * XCM connections sockets keeps track of the amount of data entering
 * or leaving the XCM layer, both from the application and to the
 * lower layer. Additionally, messaging transports also track the
 * number of messages.
 *
 * Some of the message and byte counter attributes use the concept of
 * a "lower layer". What this means depends on the transport. For the
 * UX and TCP transports, it is the Linux kernel. For example, for
 * TCP, if the xcm.to_lower_msgs is incremented, it means that XCM has
 * successfully sent the complete message to the kernel's networking
 * stack for further processing. It does not means it has reached the
 * receiving process. It may have, but it also may be sitting on the
 * local or remote socket buffer, on a NIC queue, or be in-transmit in
 * the network. For TLS, the lower layer is OpenSSL.
 *
 * The counters only reflect data succesfully sent and/or received.
 *
 * @paragraph common_cnt_attr Byte Counter Attributes
 * 
 * These counters are available on both byte stream and messaging type
 * connection sockets.
 *
 * The byte counters are incremented with the length of the XCM data
 * (as in the length field in xcm_send()), and thus does not include
 * any underlying headers or other lower layer overhead.
 *
 * Attribute Name       | Socket Type | Value Type | Mode | Description
 * ---------------------|-------- ----|------------|------|------------
 * xcm.from_app_bytes   | Connection  | Integer    | R    | Bytes sent from the application and accepted into XCM.
 * xcm.to_app_bytes     | Connection  | Integer    | R    | Bytes delivered from XCM to the application.
 * xcm.from_lower_bytes | Connection  | Integer    | R    | Bytes received by XCM from the lower layer.
 * xcm.to_lower_bytes   | Connection  | Integer    | R    | Bytes successfully sent by XCM into the lower layer.
 *
 * @paragraph messaging_cnt_attr Message Counter Attributes
 *
 * These counters are available only on messaging type connection
 * sockets.
 *
 * Attribute Name       | Socket Type | Value Type | Mode | Description
 * ---------------------|-------- ----|------------|------|------------
 * xcm.from_app_msgs    | Connection  | Integer    | R    | Messages sent from the application and accepted into XCM.
 * xcm.to_app_msgs      | Connection  | Integer    | R    | Messages delivered from XCM to the application.
 * xcm.from_lower_msgs  | Connection  | Integer    | R    | Messages received by XCM from the lower layer.
 * xcm.to_lower_msgs    | Connection  | Integer    | R    | Messages successfully sent by XCM into the lower layer.
 *
 * @section ctl Control Interface
 *
 * XCM includes a control interface, which allows iteration over the
 * OS instance's XCM server and connection sockets (for processes with
 * the appropriate permissions), and access to their attributes (see
 * @ref attributes).
 *
 * Security-sensitive attributes (e.g., @c tls.key) cannot be
 * accessed.
 *
 * The control interface is optional by means of build-time
 * configuration.
 *
 * For each XCM server or connection socket, there is a corresponding
 * UNIX domain socket which is used for control signaling (i.e. state
 * retrieval).
 *
 * @subsection ctl_dir Control UNIX Socket Directory
 *
 * By default, the control interface's UNIX domain sockets are stored in
 * the @c /run/xcm/ctl directory.
 *
 * This directory should to be created prior to running any XCM
 * applications for the control interface to worker properly and
 * should be writable for all XCM users.
 *
 * A particular process using XCM may be configured to use a
 * non-default directory for storing the UNIX domain sockets used for
 * the control interface by means of setting the @c XCM_CTL
 * variable. Please note that using this setting will cause the XCM
 * connections to be not visible globally on the OS instance (unless
 * all other XCM-using processes also are using this non-default
 * directory).
 *
 * @subsection ctl_errors Control Interface Error Handling
 *
 * Generally, since the application is left unaware (from an API
 * perspective) of the existence of the control interface, errors are
 * not reported up to the application. They are however logged.
 *
 * Application threads owning XCM sockets, but which are busy with
 * non-XCM processing for a long duration of time, or otherwise are
 * leaving their XCM sockets unattended to (in violation of XCM API
 * contract), will not respond on the control interface's UNIX domain
 * sockets (corresponding to their XCM sockets). Only the presence of
 * these sockets may be detected, but their state cannot be retrieved.
 *
 * @subsection ctl_api Control API
 *
 * Internally, the XCM implementation has control interface client
 * library, but this library's API is not public at this point.
 *
 * @subsection ctl_shell Command-line Control Program
 *
 * XCM includes a command-line program @c xcmctl which uses the @ref
 * ctl_api to iterate of the system's current XCM sockets, and allow
 * access (primarily for debugging purposes) to the sockets'
 * attributes.
 * 
 * @section thread_safety Thread Safety
 *
 * XCM API calls are MT safe provided the threads do not operate on
 * the same socket, at the same time.
 *
 * Thus, multiple threads may make XCM API calls in parallel, provided
 * the calls refer to different XCM sockets.
 *
 * An XCM socket may not be shared among different threads without
 * synchronization external to XCM. Provided calls are properly
 * serialized (e.g., with a mutex lock), a socket may be shared by
 * different threads in the samea process. However, this might prove
 * difficult since a thread in a blocking XCM function will continue
 * to hold the lock, preventing other threads from accessing the
 * socket.
 *
 * For non-blocking sockets (with external synchronization), threads
 * sharing a socket need to agree on what is the appropriate socket @p
 * condition to wait for. When this condition is met, all threads are
 * woken up, returning from select().
 *
 * It is safe to "give away" an XCM socket from one thread to another,
 * provided the appropriate memory fences are used.
 *
 * These limitations (compared to BSD Sockets) are in place to allow
 * socket state outside the kernel (which is required for TCP framing
 * and TLS).
 *
 * @section fork Multi-processing and Fork
 *
 * Sharing an XCM socket between threads in different processes is not
 * possible.
 *
 * After a fork() call, either of the two process (the parent, or the
 * child) must be designated the owner of every XCM socket the parent
 * owned.
 *
 * The owner may continue to use the XCM socket normally.
 *
 * The non-owner may not call any other XCM API call than
 * xcm_cleanup(), which frees local memory tied to this socket
 * in the non-owner's process address space, without impacting the
 * connection state in the owner process.
 *
 * @section transports Transports
 *
 * The core XCM API functions are oblivious to the transports
 * used. However, the support for building, and parsing addresses are
 * available only for a set of pre-defined set of transports. There is
 * nothing preventing xcm_addr.h from being extended, and also nothing
 * prevents an alternative XCM implementation to include more
 * transports without extending the address helper API.
 *
 * @subsection ux_transport UX Transport
 *
 * The UX transport uses UNIX Domain (AF_UNIX, also known as AF_LOCAL)
 * Sockets to providing a service of the messaging type.
 *
 * UX sockets may only be used with the same OS instance (or, more
 * specifically, between processes in the same Linux kernel network
 * namespace).
 *
 * UNIX Domain Sockets comes in a number of flavors, and XCM uses the
 * SOCK_SEQPACKET variety. SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets are
 * connection-oriented, preserves message boundaries and delivers
 * messages in the same order they were sent; perfectly matching XCM
 * semantics and provides for an near-trivial mapping.
 *
 * UX is the most efficient of the XCM transports.
 *
 * The UX transport has a nominal maximum message size of 262144
 * bytes. This limit may be lower due to conservative kernel runtime
 * configuration (i.e., low @p net.core.wmem_max values). In such
 * cases, the @p xcm.max_msg_size will reflect the actual upper limit,
 * at the time of socket creation. The max message size may change in
 * future versions of the UX transport.
 *
 * @subsubsection ux_naming UX Namespace
 *
 * The standard UNIX Domain Sockets as defined by POSIX uses the file
 * system as its namespace, with the sockets also being
 * files. However, for simplicity and to avoid situations where stale
 * socket files (originating from crashed processes) causing problems,
 * the UX transport uses a Linux-specific extension, allowing a
 * private UNIX Domain Socket namespace. This is known as the abstract
 * namespace (see the unix(7) man page for details). With the abstract
 * namespace, server socket address allocation has the same life time
 * as TCP ports (i.e. if the process dies, the address is free'd).
 *
 * The UX transport enables the SO_PASSCRED BSD socket option, to give
 * the remote peer a name (which UNIX domain connection socket doesn't
 * have by default). This is for debugging and observability purposes.
 * Without a remote peer name, in server processes with multiple
 * incoming connections to the same server socket, it's difficult to
 * say which of the server-side connection sockets goes to which
 * remote peer. The kernel-generated, unique, name is an integer in
 * the form "%05x" (printf format). Applications using hardcoded UX
 * addresses should avoid such names by, for example, using a prefix.
 *
 * The @ref utls_transport also indirectly uses the UX namespace, so
 * care should be taken to avoid any clashes between UX and UTLS
 * sockets in the same network namespace.
 *
 * @subsection uxf_transport UXF Transport
 *
 * The UXF transport is identical to the UX transport, only it uses
 * the standard POSIX naming mechanism. The name of a server socket 
 * is a file system path, and the socket is also a file.
 *
 * The UXF sockets resides in a file system namespace, as opposed to
 * UX sockets, which live in a network namespace.
 *
 * Upon xcm_close(), the socket will be closed and the file removed.
 * If an application crashes or otherwise fails to run xcm_close(), it
 * will leave a file in the file system pointing toward a non-existing
 * socket. This file will prevent the creation another server socket
 * with the same name.
 *
 * @subsection tcp_transport TCP Transport
 *
 * The TCP transport uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), by
 * means of the BSD Sockets API.
 *
 * TCP is a byte-stream service, but the XCM TCP transport adds
 * framing on top of the stream. A single-field 32-bit header
 * containing the message length in network byte order is added to
 * every message.
 *
 * TCP uses TCP Keepalive to detect lost network connectivity between
 * the peers.
 *
 * The TCP transport has a maximum message size of 262144 bytes. This
 * limit may change in future versions.
 *
 * The TCP transport supports IPv4 and IPv6.
 *
 * Since XCM is designed for signaling traffic, the TCP transport
 * disables the Nagle algorithm of TCP to avoid its excessive latency.
 *
 * @subsubsection dns_attr DNS Socket Attributes
 *
 * The TLS transport (and all other TCP protocol-based transports)
 * supports a number of socket attributes controlling DNS-related
 * behavior.
 *
 * @paragraph dns_algorithm_attr DNS Resolution and TCP Connection Establishment
 *
 * The DNS resolver used by XCM (either glibc or C-ares) sorts the A
 * and AAAA records retrieved from DNS in an order of preference,
 * before returning them to the caller. In the glibc case, the details
 * of the sorting is a function of the system's configuration
 * (i.e. /etc/gai.conf). In the C-ares case, the sorting is according
 * to RFC 6724 (with some minor deviations).
 *
 * By default, XCM will only attempt to connect to the first, most
 * preferred, address in the list of IP addresses provided by the
 * resolver. If that connection attempt fails, the XCM connection
 * establishment procedure will be terminated.
 *
 * Using the "dns.algorithm" socket attribute, the application may
 * control the DNS resolution and TCP connection establishment
 * procedure used.
 *
 * By default, "dns.algorithm" is set to "single", behaving in
 * accordance to the above description.
 *
 * If the algorithm is set to "sequential", all IP addresses will be
 * probed, in a serial manner, in the order provided by the DNS
 * resolver.
 *
 * Setting the algorithm to "happy_eyeballs" will result in RFC
 * 6555-like behavior, with two concurrent connection establishment
 * tracks; one attempting to establish an IPv4 connection and the
 * other an IPv6-based connection. The IPv6 track is given a 200 ms
 * head start.
 *
 * When the "sequential" or "happy_eyeballs" algorithm is used, only
 * the first 32 addresses provided by the resolver will be considered.
 *
 * Attribute Name  | Socket Type | Value Type | Mode | Description
 * ----------------|-------------|------------|------|------------
 * dns.algorithm   | Connection  | String     | RW   | The algorithm used for connecting to IP addresses retrieved from DNS. Must take on the value "single", "sequential", or "happy_eyeballs". See @ref dns_algorithm_attr for more information. Writable only at the time of the xcm_connect_a() call.
 * dns.timeout     | Connection  | Double     | RW   | The time (in s) until DNS resolution times out. Writable only at the time of the xcm_connect_a() call. The timeout covers the complete DNS resolution process (as opposed to a particular query-response transaction). Only available when the library is built with the c-ares DNS resolver.
 *
 * @subsubsection tcp_attr TCP Socket Attributes
 *
 * The read-only TCP attributes are retrieved from the kernel (struct
 * tcp_info in linux/tcp.h).
 *
 * Many read-write attributes are mapped directly to setsockopt() calls.
 *
 * See the tcp(7) manual page for a more detailed description of these
 * attributes. The struct retrieved with @c TCP_INFO is the basis for
 * the read-only attributes. The read-write attributes are mapped to
 * @c TCP_KEEP* and @c TCP_USER_TIMEOUT.
 *
 * Besides the TCP layer attributes, IP- and DNS-level attributes are also
 * listed here.
 *
 * Attribute Name     | Socket Type | Value Type | Mode | Description
 * -------------------|-------------|------------|------|------------
 * tcp.rtt            | Connection  | Integer    | R    | The current TCP round-trip estimate (in us).
 * tcp.total_retrans  | Connection  | Integer    | R    | The total number of retransmitted TCP segments.
 * tcp.segs_in        | Connection  | Integer    | R    | The total number of segments received.
 * tcp.segs_out       | Connection  | Integer    | R    | The total number of segments sent.
 * tcp.connect_timeout | Connection | Double     | RW   | The time (in s) until a particular TCP connection establishment attempt times out. Writable only at the time of the xcm_connect_a() call. The default is 3 s. The value of this attribute must be lower than the value of "tcp.user_timeout" to have any effect. Note that if "dns.algorithm" is set to "sequential" or "happy_eyeballs", one xcm_connect_a() call may result in several TCP connection establishment attempts.
 * tcp.user_timeout   | Connection  | Integer    | RW   | The time (in s) before a connection is dropped due to unacknowledged data. The default value is 3 s.
 * tcp.keepalive      | Connection  | Boolean    | RW   | Controls if TCP keepalive is enabled. The default value is true.
 * tcp.keepalive_time | Connection  | Integer    | RW   | The time (in s) before the first keepalive probe is sent on an idle connection. The default value is 1 s.
 * tcp.keepalive_interval | Connection | Integer | RW   | The time (in s) between keepalive probes. The default value is 1 s.
 * tcp.keepalive_count | Connection | Integer    | RW   | The number of keepalive probes sent before the connection is dropped. The default value is 3.
 * ipv6.scope         | All         | Integer    | RW   | The IPv6 scope id used. Only available on IPv6 sockets. Writable only at socket creation. If left unset, it will take on the value of 0 (the global scope). Any other value denotes the network interface index to be used, for IPv6 link local addresses. See the if_nametoindex(3) manual page for how to map interface names to indices.
 *
 * @warning @c tcp.segs_in and @c tcp.segs_out are only present when
 * running XCM on Linux kernel 4.2 or later.
 *
 * @subsection tls_transport TLS Transport
 *
 * The TLS transport uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
 * to provide a secure, private, two-way authenticated transport over
 * TCP. A TLS connection is a byte stream, but the XCM TLS transport
 * adds framing in the same manner as does the XCM TCP transport.
 *
 * The TLS transport supports IPv4 and IPv6. It disables the Nagle
 * algorithm of TCP.
 *
 * The TLS transport has a maximum message size of 262144 bytes. This
 * limit may change in future versions.
 *
 * The TLS transport honors any limitations set by the X.509
 * extended key usage extension, if present in the remote peer's
 * certificate.
 *
 * @subsubsection tls_version TLS Protocol Version and Features
 *
 * The TLS transport only employs TLS 1.2 and, if the XCM library is
 * built with OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later, TLS 1.3 as well.
 *
 * TLS 1.2 renegotiation is disabled, if the XCM library is built with
 * OpenSSL 1.1.1c or later.
 *
 * The TLS transport disables both client and server-side TLS session
 * caching, and thus does not allow for TLS session reuse across TCP
 * connections.
 *
 * @subsubsection tls_ciphers Ciphers
 *
 * The TLS 1.2 cipher list is (in order of preference, using OpenSSL
 * naming): ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256,
 * ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305,
 * ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384,
 * ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305, DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256,
 * DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, and DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305.
 *
 * The TLS 1.3 cipher suites used are: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
 * TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 and TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.
 *
 * The TLS cipher lists are neither build- nor run-time configurable.
 *
 * @subsubsection tls_certificates Certificate and Key Handling
 *
 * By default, the TLS transport reads the leaf certificate and the
 * corresponding private key from the file system, as well as a file
 * containing all trusted CA certificates. The default file system
 * paths are configured at build-time.
 *
 * @ref tls_attr may be used to override one or more of the default
 * paths, on a per-socket basis. Paths set on server sockets are
 * inherited by its connection sockets, but may in turn be overriden
 * at the time of an xcm_accept_a() call, using the proper attributes.
 *
 * The default paths may also be overriden on a per-process basis by
 * means of setting a UNIX environment variable. The current value of
 * @c XCM_TLS_CERT (at the time of xcm_connect() or xcm_accept())
 * determines the certificate directory used for that connection.
 *
 * An application may also choose to configure TLS socket credentials
 * by-value, rather than by-file-system-reference. For a particular
 * piece of information, an application must use either supply a file
 * system path (e.g., by setting @c tls.cert_file) or the actual data
 * (e.g., by passing the certificate data as the value of the @c
 * tls.cert attribute).
 *
 * Setting a credentials by-value attribute in the @c xcm_attr_map
 * passed to xcm_accept_a() will override the corresponding
 * by-reference attribute in the server socket, and vice versa.
 *
 * @paragraph credentials_format Certificate and Key Format
 *
 * Certificates (including CRLs) and private keys provided to XCM
 * (either via files or by attribute value) must be in the
 * Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format (RFC 7468).
 *
 * @paragraph per_ns_certs Per-network Namespace Certificates
 *
 * The TLS transport will, at the time of xcm_connect() or
 * xcm_server(), look up the process' current network namespace,
 * unless that file's path was given as a @ref tls_attr. If the
 * namespace is given a name per the iproute2 convention, XCM will
 * retrieve this name and use it in the certificate and key lookup.
 *
 * In case the certificate, key and trusted CA files are configured
 * using @ref tls_attr, no network namespace lookup will be performed.
 *
 * In the certificate directory (either the compile-time default, or
 * the directory specified with @c XCM_TLS_CERT), the TLS transport
 * expects the files to follow the following naming conventions
 * (where <ns> is the namespace):
 * @code
 * cert_<ns>.pem
 * @endcode
 *
 * The private key is stored in:
 * @code
 * key_<ns>.pem
 * @endcode
 *
 * The trusted CA certificates are stored in:
 * @code
 * tc_<ns>.pem
 * @endcode
 *
 * The certification revocation lists (CRLs) are stored in:
 * @code
 * crl_<ns>.pem
 * @endcode
 *
 * @paragraph default_certs Default Namespace Certificates
 *
 * For the default namespace (or rather, any network namespace not
 * named according to iproute2 standards), the certificate need to be
 * stored in a file "cert.pem" and the private key in "key.pem".
 *
 * If authentication is enabled (which it is, by default), the trusted
 * CA certificates need to be stored in a file named "tc.pem".
 *
 * If CRL checking is enabled (which it is not, by default), the CRLs
 * need to be stored in a file named "crl.pem".
 *
 * In case the appropriate credential-related files are not in place
 * (for a particular namespace), an xcm_server() call will return an
 * error and set errno to EPROTO. The application may choose to retry
 * at a later time.
 *
 * If authentication is disabled, "tc.pem" need not be present, and
 * vice versa. The same applies to CRL checking and "crl.pem"
 * availability.
 *
 * @paragraph cert_update Runtime Certificate File Updates
 *
 * In case a certificate, private key, or trusted CAs file is
 * modified, the new version of the file(s) will be used by new
 * connections. Such a change does not affect already-established
 * connections. The TLS transport works with differences between set
 * of files, and thus the new generation of files need not nesserarily
 * be newer (as in having a more recent file system mtime).
 *
 * The certificate, key and trusted CA certificates should be updated
 * in an atomic manner, or XCM may end up using the certificate file
 * from one generation of files and the key file from another, for
 * example.
 *
 * One way of achieving an atomic update is to have the three files in
 * a common directory. This certificate directory is then made a
 * symbolic link to the directory where the actual files are
 * located. Upon update, a new directory is created and populated, and
 * the old symbolic link is replace an atomic manner (i.e. with
 * rename(2)).
 *
 * @subsubsection tls_role Role Configuration
 *
 * By default, on sockets that represent the client side of an XCM TLS
 * connection (e.g., returned from xcm_connect_a()), the XCM TLS
 * transport will act as a TLS client. Similarly, the default behavior
 * for sockets representing the XCM (and TCP) server side of a
 * connection is to act as a TLS server.
 *
 * The default may be changed by setting the "tls.client" attribute,
 * so that sockets that are XCM (and TCP) level clients, act as TLS
 * servers, and vice versa. If the value is true, the socket will act
 * as a TLS client, and if false, the socket is a TLS server.
 *
 * Connection sockets created by xcm_accept() or xcm_accept_a()
 * inherit the "tls.client" attribute value from their parent server
 * sockets.
 *
 * The TLS role must be specified at the time of socket
 * creation, and thus cannot be changed on already-established
 * connections.
 *
 * @subsubsection tls_auth Authentication
 *
 * By default, both the client and server side authenticate the other
 * peer, often referred to as _mutual TLS_ (mTLS).
 *
 * TLS remote peer authentication may be disabled by setting the
 * "tls.auth" socket attribute to false. The default value is true.
 *
 * Connection sockets created by xcm_accept() or xcm_accept_a()
 * inherit the "tls.auth" attribute value from their parent server
 * sockets.
 *
 * The "tls.auth" socket attribute may only be set at the time of
 * socket creation (except for server sockets).
 *
 * @subsubsection name_verification X.509v3 Subject Name Verification
 *
 * The TLS transport supports verifying the remote peer's certificate
 * subject name against an application-specified expected name, or a
 * set of names. "Subject name" here is used as per RFC 6125
 * definition, and is either a Distingushed Name (DN) of the X.509
 * certificate's subject field, or a DNS type subject alternative name
 * extension. XCM does not make any distinction between the two.
 *
 * Subject name verification may be enabled by setting the
 * "tls.verify_peer_name" socket attribute to true. It is disabled by
 * default.
 *
 * If enabled, XCM will verify the hostname in the address supplied in
 * the xcm_connect_a() call. In case the attribute "tls.peer_names" is
 * also supplied, it overrides this behavior. The value of this
 * attribute is a ':'-separated set of subject names. "tls.peer_names"
 * may not be set unless "tls.verify_peer_name" is set to true.
 *
 * If there is a non-zero overlap between these two sets, the
 * verification is considered successful. The actual procedure is
 * delegated to OpenSSL. Wildcard matching is disabled (@c
 * X509_CHECK_FLAG_NO_WILDCARDS) and the check includes the subject
 * field (@c X509_CHECK_FLAG_ALWAYS_CHECK_SUBJECT).
 *
 * Subject name verification may be used both by a client (in its
 * xcm_connect_a() call) or by a server (in xcm_server_a() or
 * xcm_accept_a()). "tls.peer_names" must be specified in case
 * "tls.verify_peer_name" is set to true on connection sockets created
 * by accepting a TLS connection from a server socket (since there is
 * no hostname to fall back to).
 *
 * Connection sockets created by xcm_accept() or xcm_accept_a()
 * inherit the "tls.verify_name" and "tls.peer_names" attributes from
 * their parent server sockets.
 *
 * After a connection is established, the "tls.peer_names" will be
 * updated to reflect the remote peer's actual subject names, as
 * opposed to those which were originally allowed.
 *
 * OpenSSL refers to this functionality as hostname validation, and
 * that is also how it's usually used. However, the subject name
 * passed in "tls.peer_names" need not be DNS domain name, but can be
 * any kind of name or identifier. All names must follow DNS domain
 * name syntax rules (including label and total length limitations).
 * Also, while uppercase and lowercase letters are allowed in domain
 * names, no significance is attached to the case.
 *
 * @subsubsection crl_checks Certification Revocation List Checks
 *
 * The XCM TLS transport may be asked to perform checks against one or
 * more Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
 *
 * CRL checking is enabled by setting the "tls.check_crl" socket
 * attribute to true during socket creation (e.g., when calling
 * xcm_connect_a()). CRL checking is disabled by default. CRL checking
 * may be employed by both TLS client and server endpoints.
 *
 * The default CRL file location may be overriden using the
 * "tls.crl_file" attribute. Alternatively, the CRL data may be
 * provided by-value using the "tls.crl" attribute.
 *
 * The CRL bundle must be in PEM format, and must be present and valid
 * if CRL checking is enabled.
 *
 * The full chain is checked against the user-provided CRLs (i.e., in
 * OpenSSL terms, both the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK and
 * X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL flags are set).
 *
 * CRL checking is only meaningful (and allowed) when authentication
 * is enabled.
 *
 * Due to a bug in OpenSSL, partial chains (i.e., where the trust
 * anchor is a trusted non-root certificate) is not allowed when CRL
 * checking is enabled. In OpenSSL terms, X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN is
 * disabled when X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL is enabled. Future versions
 * of XCM, built against newer versions of OpenSSL, may allow partial
 * chains in combination with CRL checking.
 *
 * @subsubsection validity_checks Certificate Validity Period Checks
 *
 * By default, the XCM TLS transport checks the validity period of
 * each X.509 certificate in the chain of trust, down to and including
 * the remote peer's leaf certificate, against the current system
 * time. If any certificate is found to be either not yet valid or
 * expired, TLS connection establishment is aborted.
 *
 * A socket may be configured to accept not-yet-valid certificates and
 * expired certificates by setting the "tls.check_time" to false.
 *
 * Connection sockets created by xcm_accept() or xcm_accept_a()
 * inherit the "tls.check_time" attribute value from their parent
 * server sockets.
 *
 * @subsubsection tls_attr TLS Socket Attributes
 *
 * Attribute Name           | Socket Type | Value Type  | Mode | Description
 * -------------------------|-------------|-------------|------|------------
 * tls.cert_file            | All         | String      | RW   | The leaf certificate file. Writable only at socket creation.
 * tls.key_file             | All         | String      | RW   | The leaf certificate private key file. Writable only at socket creation.
 * tls.tc_file              | All         | String      | RW   | The trusted CA certificates bundle file. Writable only at socket creation. May not be set if authentication is disabled.
 * tls.crl_file             | Al l        | String      | RW   | The certificate verification list (CRL) bundle. Writable only at socket creation. May only be set if CRL checking is enabled.
 * tls.cert                 | All         | Binary      | RW   | The leaf certificate to be used. Writable only at socket creation.
 * tls.key                  | All         | Binary      | RW   | The leaf certificate private key to be used. Writable only at socket creation. For security reasons, the value of this attribute is not available over the XCM control interface.
 * tls.tc                   | All         | Binary      | RW   | The trusted CA certificates bundle to be used. Writable only at socket creation. May not be set if authentication is disabled.
 * tls.crl                  | All         | Binary      | RW   | The certificate verification list (CRL) bundle to be used. Writable only at socket creation. May only be set if CRL checking is enabled.
 * tls.client               | All         | Boolean     | RW   | Controls whether to act as a TLS-level client or a server. Writable only at socket creation.
 * tls.auth                 | All         | Boolean     | RW   | Controls whether or not to authenticate the remote peer. Writable only at socket creation. Default value is true.
 * tls.check_crl            | All         | Boolean     | RW   | Controls whether or not to perform CRL checking. Writable only at socket creation. Default value is false.
 * tls.check_time           | All         | Boolean     | RW   | Controls if the X.509 certificate validity period is honored. Writable only at socket creation. Default is true.
 * tls.verify_peer_name     | All         | Boolean     | RW   | Controls if subject name verification should be performed. Writable only at socket creation. Default value is false.
 * tls.peer_names           | All         | String      | RW   | At socket creation, a list of acceptable peer subject names. After connection establishment, a list of actual peer subject names. Writable only at socket creation.
 * tls.peer_subject_key_id  | Connection  | String      | R    | The X509v3 Subject Key Identifier of the remote peer, or a zero-length string in case no certificate available (e.g, the TLS connection is not established or TLS authentication is disabled and the remote peer did not send a certificate).
 * tls.peer.cert.subject.cn | Connection  | String      | R    | The common name (CN) of the remote peer's subject field, provided the certificate (including a CN in the subject DN) exists.
 * tls.peer.cert.san.dns  | Connection  | List        | R    | A list of strings, where each element is a remote peer's subject alternative name (SAN) of the DNS type. The subject field CN is not included in this list.
 * tls.peer.cert.san.emails | Connection | List        | R    | A list of strings, where each element is a remote peer's SAN of the RFC 822 type.
 * tls.peer.cert.san.dirs | Connection | List        | R    | A list of dictionaries. Each element represents is a remote peer's SAN of the directory name type, and contains the key "cn", holding the directory name DN's CN, if the CN is present.
 *
 * In addition to the TLS-specific attributes, a TLS socket also has
 * all the @ref dns_attr and @ref tcp_attr (including the IP-level
 * attributes).
 *
 * @subsection utls_transport UTLS Transport
 *
 * The UTLS transport provides a hybrid transport, utilizing both the
 * TLS and UX transports internally for actual connection
 * establishment and message delivery.
 *
 * On the client side, at the time of xcm_connect(), the UTLS
 * transport determines if the server socket can be reached by using
 * the UX transport (i.e. if the server socket is located on the same
 * OS instance, in the same network namespace). If not, UTLS will
 * attempt to reach the server by means of the TLS transport.
 *
 * For a particular UTLS connection, either TLS or UX is used (never
 * both). XCM connections to a particular UTLS server socket may be a
 * mix of the two different types.
 *
 * For an UTLS server socket with the address <tt>utls:<ip>:<port></tt>,
 * two underlying addresses will be allocated;
 * <tt>tls:<ip>:<port></tt> and <tt>ux:<ip>:<port></tt>.
 *
 * In case DNS is used:
 * <tt>tls:<hostname>:<port></tt> and <tt>ux:<hostname>:<port></tt>.
 *
 * @subsubsection utls_attr UTLS Socket Attributes
 *
 * UTLS sockets accept all the @ref tls_attr, as well as the @ref
 * xcm_attr. In case a UTLS connection is being established as a UX
 * connection socket, all TLS attributes are ignored.
 *
 * @subsubsection utls_limitations UTLS Limitations
 *
 * A wildcard should never be used when creating a UTLS server socket.
 *
 * If a DNS hostname is used in place of the IP address, both the
 * client and server need employ DNS, and also agree upon which
 * hostname to use (in case there are several pointing at the same IP
 * address).
 *
 * Failure to adhere to the above two rules will prevent a client from
 * finding a local server. Such a client will instead establish a TLS
 * connection to the server.
 *
 * @subsection sctp_transport SCTP Transport
 *
 * The SCTP transport uses the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
 * (SCTP). SCTP provides a reliable, message-oriented
 * service. In-order delivery is optional, but to adhere to XCM
 * semantics (and for other reasons) XCM leaves SCTP in-order delivery
 * enabled.
 *
 * The SCTP transport utilizes the native Linux kernel's
 * implementation of SCTP, via the BSD Socket API. The operating mode
 * is such that there is a 1:1-mapping between an association and a
 * socket (fd).
 *
 * The SCTP transport supports IPv4 and IPv6.
 *
 * To minimize latency, the SCTP transport disables the Nagle
 * algorithm.
 *
 * The SCTP transport has a maximum message size of 65535 bytes. This
 * limit may change in future versions.
 *
 * @subsection btcp_transport BTCP Transport
 *
 * The BTCP transport provides a reliable two-way byte stream service
 * over TCP.
 *
 * Unlike the @ref tcp_transport, BTCP doesn't use a framing header or
 * anything else on the wire protocol level that is specific to
 * XCM. In other words, it's a "raw" TCP connection.
 *
 * Other than the above-mentioned differences, BTCP is identical to
 * the @ref tcp_transport, including supported @ref dns_attr and @ref
 * tcp_attr.
 *
 * @subsection btls_transport BTLS Transport
 *
 * The BTLS transport provides a direct mapping to the Transport Layer
 * Security (TLS) protocol over TCP. It provides a secure, private,
 * two-way authenticated byte stream service.
 *
 * BTLS has the same relationship to the @ref tls_transport as the
 * @ref tcp_transport has to the @ref tcp_transport.
 *
 * BTLS doesn't add a framing header or any other XCM BTLS-level
 * protocol artefacts on top of the TLS session. In other words, it's
 * a "raw" TLS connection.
 *
 * Other than providing a byte stream, it's identical to the @ref
 * tls_transport, including supported @ref dns_attr, @ref tcp_attr and
 * @ref tls_attr.
 *
 * @section namespaces Linux Network and IPC Namespaces
 *
 * Namespaces is a Linux kernel facility concept for creating multiple,
 * independent namespaces for kernel resources of a certain kind.
 *
 * Linux Network Namespaces will affect all transports, except the
 * @ref uxf_transport.
 *
 * XCM has no explicit namespace support. Rather, the application is
 * expected to use the Linux kernel facilities for this functionality
 * (i.e. switch to the right namespace before xcm_server() och
 * xcm_connect()).
 *
 * In case the system follows the iproute2 conventions in regards to
 * network namespace naming, the TLS and UTLS transports support
 * per-network namespace TLS certificates and private keys.
 *
 * @section tracing Tracing
 *
 * In case XCM is built with LTTng support, the XCM library will
 * register two tracepoints: @c com_ericsson_xcm:xcm_debug and @c
 * com_ericsson_xcm:xcm_error. The @c xcm_debug is verbose indeed,
 * while messages on @c xcm_error are rare indeed. The latter is
 * mostly due to the fact there are very few conditions that the
 * library reliable can classify as errors, since many "errors" [e.g.,
 * connection refused] may well be the expected result).
 *
 * If the XCM_DEBUG environment variable is set, the same trace
 * messages that are routed via the LTTng tracepoints, are printed to
 * stderr of the process linked to the library.
 *
 * The tracepoint names and the format of the messages are subject to
 * change, and not to be considered a part of the XCM API.

/** Inform socket of which operations the application is waiting to
 *  perform.
 *
 * This function is only used by event-driven application and with XCM
 * sockets in non-blocking mode. For an overview on this subject, see
 * @ref select.
 *
 * Using xcm_await(), the application informs the XCM socket what
 * conditions it's waiting for (i.e. what XCM operations it wants to
 * perform). These conditions are stored in the socket, and won't
 * change until the application calls xcm_await() again.
 *
 * The @p condition parameter is a bitmask, with the valid bits being
 * @ref XCM_SO_RECEIVABLE or @ref XCM_SO_SENDABLE (for connection
 * socket) or @ref XCM_SO_ACCEPTABLE (for server sockets). If no bits
 * are set, the application is not interested in anything beyond the
 * XCM socket to finish any outstanding tasks.
 *
 * Typically, the application would call xcm_await() when an XCM
 * operation (such as xcm_receive()) has failed with errno set to
 * EAGAIN. However, the application may also call xcm_await() even
 * though neither xcm_send(), xcm_receive(), nor xcm_finish() has
 * failed in such a manner.
 *
 * In case any of the conditions the application is asking for are
 * believed to be met already at the time of the xcm_await() call, the
 * XCM socket fd (see xcm_fd() for details) will be marked as ready to
 * be read.
 *
 * The conditions specified by the application are future operation it
 * wishes to perform on a socket (as opposed to finishing operations
 * the socket has already accepted). For example, if an application
 * use xcm_send() to transmit a message, and the XCM socket accept
 * this request (by returning 0 on the call), the application
 * shouldn't send @ref XCM_SO_SENDABLE flag for the reason of having
 * XCM finishing the transmission; the task of actually handing over
 * message to the lower layer is performed by XCM regardless of the
 * conditions specified.
 *
 * Even though XCM socket fd is marked readable (by select()), and
 * thus the application-specified conditions for a particular
 * connection socket are likely met, there's no guarantee that the API
 * operation (i.e. xcm_send(), xcm_receive() or xcm_accept()) will
 * succeed.
 *
 * If an application is waiting for both XCM_SO_SENDABLE and
 * XCM_SO_RECEIVABLE, is should try both to send and receive when the
 * socket fd is marked readable.
 *
 * @param[in] socket The XCM socket.
 * @param[in] condition The condition the application is waiting for.
 *
 * @return Returns 0 on success, or -1 if an error occured (in which
 *         case errno is set).
 *
 * errno        | Description
 * -------------|------------
 * EINVAL       | The socket is not in non-blocking mode, or the condition bits are invalid.

 *
 * Progress can mean both progress toward the goal of reaching the
 * application's desired socket condition (see xcm_await() for
 * details), or finishing any outstanding task the XCM socket has.
 *
 * Note that the XCM socket fd is @a only ever marked readable
 * (as opposed to writable). This is true even if the application is
 * waiting to send a message on the socket. Marked readable means that
 * the fd is, for example, marked with EPOLLIN, in case epoll_wait()
 * is used, or has its bit set in the @p readfs fd_set, in case
 * select() is used.
 *
 * When the XCM socket fd becomes readable, an application would
 * typically perform the actions it specified in xcm_await()'s
 * condition parameter. It is not forced to do so, but may choose to
 * perform other API operations instead. However, if neither
 * xcm_send() nor xcm_receive() is called, the application must call
 * xcm_finish(). The xcm_finish() call must be made, even though the

 * make progress on its background tasks. See @ref outstanding_tasks
 * for details.
